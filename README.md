# Rotten-Tomatoes-Web-Scraper

I wanted this to be a project that I completed by myself end-to-end. The goal was to scrape my own data from the internet, clean the data, and build an LSTM model that performs a sentiment analysis on all of the movie reviews I scraped from Rotten Tomatoes. There are public datasets available on Rotten Tomatoes reviews, as I found out later in the project, but I wanted to collect my own for experience.

There already exists a Rotten Tomatoes dataset just like the one I am trying to make here. I did not come across this work until I was already through the beginning stages of this project, but I shall link that dataset here for anyone interested. This guy also has other movie datasets on Kaggle and seems like an interesting guy. Check him out: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset

Anyway, it was also good to know that the creator of the above dataset also had to wait a day or so for all the data to be collected.
