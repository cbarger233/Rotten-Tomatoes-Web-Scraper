# Rotten-Tomatoes-Web-Scraper

This is currently a work-in-progress. I want to use this as practice for data collection for data science skills. I wanted a dataset to perform analyses on, but I felt I needed to create my own extensive dataset.

Unfortunately (or, should I say, good for the person who already did it) there already exists a Rotten Tomatoes dataset just like the one I am trying to make here. I did not come across this work until I was already through the beginning stages of this project, but I shall link that dataset here for anyone interested. This guy also has other movie datasets on Kaggle and seems like an interesting guy. Check him out: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset

Anyway, it was also good to know that the creator of the above dataset also had to wait a day or so for all the data to be collected.

Below you will find a test I did on the movie Interstellar, my favorite movie which did not make the top 100 movie list for 2014 somehow....

Below that I have defined some functions to aid in the collection of review data for the top 100 movies for each year between 2000 and 2021. Collecting all this data takes a long time. You will see somewhere in the comments me complaining about my poor internet, and how I had to settle for only scraping data for the year 2021 as a result.

I plan to work on this more in the future. In addition to the collection of data, I wish to do some sentiment analysis using NLP to see if I can predict whether a review is fresh or rotten. Hopefully I have time to work on that soon.
