    "# Rotten Tomatoes Web Scraper for Top 100 Movies Between 2000 and 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently a work-in-progress. I want to use this as practice for data collection for data science skills. I wanted a dataset to perform analyses on, but I felt I needed to create my own extensive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately (or, should I say, good for the person who already did it) there already exists a Rotten Tomatoes dataset just like the one I am trying to make here. I did not come across this work until I was already through the beginning stages of this project, but I shall link that dataset here for anyone interested. This guy also has other movie datasets on Kaggle and seems like an interesting guy. Check him out: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, it was also good to know that the creator of the above dataset also had to wait a day or so for all the data to be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find a test I did on the movie Interstellar, my favorite movie which did not make the top 100 movie list for 2014 somehow....\n",
    "\n",
    "Below that I have defined some functions to aid in the collection of review data for the top 100 movies for each year between 2000 and 2021. Collecting all this data takes a *long* time. You will see somewhere in the comments me complaining about my poor internet, and how I had to settle for only scraping data for the year 2021 as a result."
